# Cellular Automaton Visualizer

![Cellular Automaton Visualizer Demo](demo.gif)

## Description

"Cellular Automaton Visualizer" is a JavaScript application that allows users to explore and visualize cellular automata patterns. Cellular automata are discrete mathematical models that exhibit complex behavior arising from simple rules applied iteratively to grid-based structures. This application provides an interactive interface where users can specify a rule number and observe how the cellular automaton evolves over time, generating intricate patterns and structures. The visualization is rendered on an HTML canvas, providing real-time feedback as the automaton progresses through each generation. With intuitive controls and dynamic visualizations, "Cellular Automaton Visualizer" offers an engaging platform for exploring the fascinating world of emergent complexity in cellular automata.

To learn more about Cellular Automaton and the rules generating over 200 distinct patterns, I recommend checking out <a href='https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html'>Wolfram's MathWorld</a>.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of cellular automata patterns.
- Specification of rule number to explore different automaton behaviors.
- Real-time rendering on an HTML canvas for dynamic feedback.
- Intuitive controls for ease of use and exploration.

## Usage

To use the "Cellular Automaton Visualizer," simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Enter a rule number in the input field and click the "Update Rule" button to visualize the corresponding cellular automaton pattern. The animation will start automatically and display the evolving pattern on the canvas.
